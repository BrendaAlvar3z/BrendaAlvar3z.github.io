          <p class="safety-intro">Meeting new cats is exciting, but you should always be cautious when interacting with cats you don't know. Use your best judgment and put your safety first, whether you are exchanging initial messages meeing in person. While you can't control the actions of other cats, there are things you can do to help you stay safe during your WHISKERS experience.</p>

          <ul class="bullet safety-list">
            <li class="list-item">Never send money or share financial information</li>
            <p>Never send money, especially over wire tranfer, even if the cat claims to be in an emergency. Never share information that could be used to access your financial accounts, or steal your identity. If another user asks for this information, report it to us immediately</p>
            <li class="list-item">Protect your personal information</li>
            <p>Never share personal information, such as your social security number, home or work address, or details about your daily routine with cats you don't know. If you have kittens, limit the information that you share about your children on your profile and early meetings.</p>
            <li class="list-item">Be wary of long distance and/or overseas relationships</li>
            <p>Watch out for scammers who claim to be from your country, but are stuck somewhere else, especially if they ask for financial help to return home. Be wary of anyone who refuses to meet in person or talk on a phone/video call--they may not be who they say they are. If someone is avoiding your questions or pushing for a serious relationship without meeting or getting to know you first--that's a red flag.</p>
            <li class="list-item">Report all suspicious and offensive behavior</li>
            <p>When a cat does something that crosses the line, we want to know about it. Block and report to anyone that violates our terms. For more information, check out our Community Guidelines.</p>
            <li class="list-item">Protect your account</li>
            <p>Be sure to pick a strong password, make sure to share it with cats you trust, and always be careful when logging in from a public or shared computer.</p>

          <ul class="bullet safety-list">
            <li class="list-item">Don't be in a rush</li>
            <p>Take your time and get to know the other cat before agreeting to meet or chat in person. Don't be afraid to ask question to screen for any red flags or personal dealbreakers.</p>
            <li class="list-item">Meet in public and stay in public</li>
            <p>Meet for the first few times in a populated, public place -- never at your home, your date's home, or any other private location. If your date preessures you to go to a private location, end the date.</p>
            <li class="list-item">Tell friends and family about your plans</li>
            <p>Tell a friend or family member of your plans, including when and where you're going.</p>
            <li class="list-item">Be in control of your transportation</li>
            <p>We want you to be in control of how you get to and from your date so that you can leave whenever you want. If you're driving yourself, it's a good idea to have a backup plan such as a ride-share app or a friend to pick you up.</p>
            <li class="list-item">Know your limits</li>
            <p>Be aware of the effects of catnit or alcohol on you specifically -- they can impair your judgment and your alertness. If your date tries to pressure you to use catnip more than you're comfortable with, hold your ground and end the date.</p>
            <li class="list-item">If you feel uncomfortable, leave</li>
            <p>It's okay to end the date early if you're feeling uncomfortable.</p>
